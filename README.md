## About
Mangaself is a simple manga/comics library app that lets you create and manage your own collection directly on your Android device. You can use your own folders as sources.

The app supports indexing your manga manually or fetching basic metadata from [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/). Library metadata is stored locally, while additional metadata is retrieved from the [MangaDex API](https://api.mangadex.org/). You can also self host the Mangself API and access it in the app remotely.

## Features
- Create and manage multiple profiles.
- Add manga/comics from local folders (or zip/czf files in future).
- Index manga manually or fetch metadata from MangaDex.
- Automatically track reading progress.
- Support for both local storage and remote API.
